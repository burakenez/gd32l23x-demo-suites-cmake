  This demo is based on the GD32L235R-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to use the SLCD
peripheral to work with glass SLCD.

  For the reason SLCD and RTC share the same clock, we must configure the clock
of RTC first, this demo use RC32K(its frequence is 32K) to drive the SLCD peripheral.

  For GD32L235R-EVAL-V1.0, the SLCD peripheral use 1/4 Bias voltage, 1/8 duty, 125Hz update
frequence to display numbers.

  Jump JP1, JP2, JP4, JP7, JP8, JP9, JP10, JP11, JP12, JP18, JP19, JP20, JP21, JP22, JP23, 
and JP24 to SLCD.
